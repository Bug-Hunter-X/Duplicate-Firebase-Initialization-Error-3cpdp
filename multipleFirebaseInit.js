The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the `initializeApp` function is called multiple times with different configurations. This can happen if you accidentally initialize Firebase in multiple places in your application, or if you're using different configuration objects in different parts of your code.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.  Example:

```javascript
// Incorrect - Multiple initializations
firebase.initializeApp(config1);
firebase.initializeApp(config2);
```
